# Temp-Converter
Project Name: Temperature Converter

Introduction: While I was looking for the projects, I found a loan calculator. Once I enter a year and interest rate, it automatically calculates for me. Based on that code, I would like to build an app that will be beneficial to me. As a person who came from South Korea, one of the challenges for me is reading a temperature. The United States is using Fahrenheit and not many countries using Fahrenheit. In the temperature converter, I can put any number and by clicking the button, it will automatically calculate to Celsius or Fahrenheit.

Target Users: The main target user for my app is foreigners who came from the countries that are using Celsius to indicate the temperature. It is hard for foreigners to see the Fahrenheit and understand how cold or warm it is. By entering the number, it will convert Fahrenheit to Celsius. Also, Americans can use this app well. When Americans travel to other countries, they will have a hard time understanding the temperature in Celsius. In addition to that, I had a conversation with my roommate who is taking a lab class. He said they are using Celsius while experimenting. American students can use the Temperature Converter to convert Celsius to complete the experiment.

App Function: Users will have to enter a number that they want to convert. There will be two buttons that they can use. If they want to change the number to Celsius, they will have to click the Celsius. The outcome will be displayed at the bottom. If they want to convert the number to Fahrenheit, click the Fahrenheit button. Please see attached image for design.
